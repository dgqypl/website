## Security Information

- Through deploying system-level network security measures, ensure the security of the system platform. Specific measures are:

    - Communication between components is completely encrypted using HTTPS to effectively prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks, and prevent information from being monitored.
    - Each service uses an independent service account, and the account used to access the database for each service is an independent account to avoid risks caused by account information leakage.
    - REST API calls between services need to be authorized through keystone authentication to prevent unauthorized API access.
    - Adopt network security policies, in the private deployment environment, use Calico network policies to limit unnecessary server port exposure, and in the public cloud deployment environment, apply public cloud VPC security group policies to limit unnecessary service port exposure and reduce the risk of network attacks on services.

- Through account security measures, ensure the security of the platform. The main measures are:

    - Account security: To ensure the security of login account passwords, mandatory password complexity (password length and character types included), regular password expiration, and historical password repetition verification.
    - Login Security: To ensure account login security, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), restrict users to have only one valid login session, allow disabling of console login permissions or API access permissions for specific users, and disable accounts if a user fails to log in with the correct password multiple times.
